# Sentiment-Analysis
This project analyzes product reviews using both classical and deep learning-based sentiment analysis models. It leverages NLTK's VADER for rule-based sentiment scoring and Hugging Face's RoBERTa model for transformer-based analysis. The project compares the performance of both models and explores specific cases where their sentiment scores differ.
